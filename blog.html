      <h2>AI and Music Creation</h2>
      <p><em>Published: October 22, 2025</em></p>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world of music in fascinating ways. From composing melodies to generating harmonies and even simulating the nuances of human instruments, AI tools are giving musicians new creative possibilities.</p>
      
      <p>With AI, composers can experiment with different genres and styles instantly, creating unique soundscapes that would take months or years manually. Musicians are also collaborating with AI systems to overcome creative blocks, explore new rhythms, and even produce entire tracks autonomously.</p>
